# MediConnect: Healthcare Appointment and Telemedicine Platform

## Project Overview

MediConnect is a full-stack web application for healthcare management, allowing patients to book appointments, conduct telemedicine video calls, manage medical records, and use an AI-driven symptom checker. Doctors manage schedules and patient interactions, while admins monitor platform usage. Built with free, open-source tools, it showcases advanced Node.js, Express, and React skills in a medical context.

## Objectives

- Develop a complex full-stack application using free tools to demonstrate proficiency in Node.js, Express, and React.
- Implement healthcare-specific features like telemedicine, secure patient records, and AI symptom analysis.
- Ensure scalability, security, and compliance with medical data standards (e.g., HIPAA-like practices).
- Deploy a live demo using free hosting for portfolio presentation.

## Tech Stack (All Free/Open-Source)

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS (via CDN), Redux Toolkit for state management.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js.
- **Database**: MongoDB Community Edition (or MongoDB Atlas free tier) for patient records, appointments, and prescriptions.
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with bcrypt for password hashing.
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO for chat; PeerJS (free WebRTC) for video calls.
- **File Storage**: Local file storage with Multer for medical documents (e.g., prescriptions, reports).
- **AI Symptom Checker**: TensorFlow.js (free, browser-based ML) for client-side symptom analysis.
- **Deployment**: Render (free tier) for backend, Vercel (free tier) for frontend, MongoDB Atlas (free tier) for database.
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Cypress for end-to-end tests.
- **Other Tools**:
  - Nodemailer with free SMTP (e.g., Gmail) for appointment reminders.
  - Chart.js for analytics dashboards.
  - Redis (free Redis Labs tier) for caching (optional).
  - Git with GitHub for version control.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Register/login for patients, doctors, and admins with JWT.
   - Role-based access control (RBAC): patients book appointments, doctors manage schedules, admins oversee platform.
   - Password reset via email with Nodemailer.
2. **Appointment Scheduling**:
   - Patients: Book appointments with doctors based on availability.
   - Doctors: Manage schedules, accept/reject appointments.
   - Calendar view with time slot selection.
3. **Telemedicine Video Calls**:
   - Real-time video consultations using PeerJS (WebRTC).
   - Secure, peer-to-peer video calls without paid APIs.
4. **Patient Records Management**:
   - Patients: Upload medical documents (e.g., lab reports) with Multer.
   - Doctors: View patient records, add prescriptions, and update medical history.
   - Secure storage with encryption for sensitive data.
5. **AI Symptom Checker**:
   - Client-side symptom analysis using TensorFlow.js.
   - Input symptoms (e.g., fever, cough) to suggest possible conditions (e.g., flu, cold).
   - Disclaimer: For demo purposes, not a substitute for professional diagnosis.
6. **Real-time Chat**:
   - In-app messaging between patients and doctors using Socket.IO.
   - Support for pre-consultation queries and follow-ups.
7. **Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Doctors: View appointment trends and patient engagement.
   - Admins: Monitor platform metrics (e.g., active users, appointment volume).
   - Patients: Track appointment history and health progress.
8. **Notifications**:
   - Email/SMS reminders for appointments using Nodemailer.
   - In-app notifications for appointment updates and messages.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Backend Development (Node.js/Express)

- **Setup**: Initialize Node.js/Express project, configure `dotenv` for environment variables.
- **Database Schema (MongoDB)**:
  - Users: `_id`, email, password (hashed), role (patient/doctor/admin), profile (e.g., doctor specialty).
  - Appointments: `_id`, patient_id, doctor_id, date, time, status (pending/confirmed/completed).
  - Records: `_id`, patient_id, doctor_id, document_url, notes, prescriptions, timestamp.
  - Messages: `_id`, sender_id, receiver_id, content, timestamp.
- **APIs**:
  - Auth: `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/reset-password`.
  - Appointment: `/api/appointments` (book, update, cancel), `/api/doctors/:id/schedule`.
  - Record: `/api/records` (upload, view, update).
  - Message: `/api/messages` (send, retrieve).
- **Real-time**:
  - Socket.IO for chat and appointment status updates.
  - PeerJS for video calls, using free PeerJS server or self-hosted.
- **File Uploads**: Use Multer for local storage of medical documents with size limits.
- **AI Symptom Checker**:
  - Train a simple TensorFlow.js model on a small dataset (e.g., symptom-to-condition mappings).
  - Expose an endpoint or run client-side for symptom analysis.
- **Security**:
  - Use bcrypt for password hashing, JWT for auth.
  - Encrypt sensitive record data with `crypto` module.
  - Sanitize inputs with `express-validator` to prevent injection.

### 2. Frontend Development (React)

- **Setup**: Initialize React with Vite, add Tailwind CSS via CDN, and set up Redux Toolkit.
- **Components**:
  - Auth: Login, Register, Password Reset forms.
  - Appointment: Calendar view, Booking form, Appointment history.
  - Telemedicine: Video call interface with PeerJS.
  - Records: Upload form, Record viewer, Prescription list.
  - Symptom Checker: Form to input symptoms, display results.
  - Chat: Real-time messaging interface.
  - Dashboard: Chart.js visualizations for analytics.
- **State Management**: Use Redux Toolkit for user, appointment, and record states.
- **Real-time**: Connect to Socket.IO for chat; integrate PeerJS for video.
- **Routing**: Use React Router for navigation (e.g., `/appointments`, `/telemedicine/:id`).
- **Responsive Design**: Use Tailwind CSS for mobile-first UI.

### 3. Database (MongoDB)

- Use MongoDB Atlas (free tier, 500MB) or Community Edition.
- Design schema with Mongoose for validation and relationships.
- Index fields like `user.email` and `appointment.date` for performance.

### 4. AI Symptom Checker

- **Model**: Use TensorFlow.js for a lightweight, client-side ML model.
- **Data**: Create a small JSON dataset (e.g., symptoms: \["fever", "cough"\], condition: "possible flu").
- **Implementation**: Run inference in the browser to suggest conditions based on user input.
- **Disclaimer**: Clearly state the tool is for demo purposes, not medical advice.

### 5. Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Use Jest for API endpoints (e.g., appointment booking, record upload).
- **End-to-End Tests**: Use Cypress for user flows (e.g., book appointment â†’ start video call).
- **Mocking**: Mock MongoDB, Socket.IO, and PeerJS for testing.

### 6. Deployment

- **Backend**: Deploy to Render (free tier) with Node.js.
- **Frontend**: Deploy to Vercel (free tier) with automatic scaling.
- **Database**: Use MongoDB Atlas (free tier).
- **PeerJS Server**: Self-host a PeerJS server on Render or use the free PeerJS cloud.
- **CI/CD**: Use GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

### 7. Stretch Goals

- **Multi-language Support**: Add i18n for internationalization.
- **Prescription Validation**: Add a feature to verify prescription formats.
- **Offline Support**: Use Service Workers for caching appointment data.
- **Analytics Enhancements**: Add more Chart.js visualizations (e.g., doctor availability trends).

## Learning Outcomes

- **Node.js/Express**: Build secure REST APIs, handle file uploads, and implement real-time features.
- **React**: Master complex UI, state management, and responsive design.
- **MongoDB**: Design and query complex schemas for healthcare data.
- **Real-time**: Use Socket.IO and PeerJS for chat and video calls.
- **AI**: Implement a client-side ML model with TensorFlow.js.
